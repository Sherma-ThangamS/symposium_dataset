# **NBS Handbook 138 - Dataset Summary and RAG Chatbot Implementation Guide**

## üìÑ **Overview**  
This dataset is derived from the **NBS Handbook 138**, which contains comprehensive medical, scientific, and technical information. The data is structured to support the development of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot**, ideal for answering medical, scientific, and technical questions.  

The dataset is suitable for:  
‚úÖ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks  
‚úÖ **Question Answering (QA) Systems**  
‚úÖ **Information Retrieval**  
‚úÖ **Knowledge Base Creation**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Preprocessing Steps**  

### **1. Data Extraction**  
- Extracted text from the `nbshandbook138.pdf` file.  
- Segmented the content into well-defined sections (e.g., Definitions, Explanations, Units, etc.).  

### **2. Text Cleaning**  
- Removed irrelevant content such as page numbers, headers, and footnotes.  
- Standardized text by converting it to lowercase.  
- Removed special characters, excessive whitespace, and non-essential symbols.  

### **3. Data Structuring**  
- Divided content into meaningful sections for efficient retrieval.  
- Created metadata tags to enhance search accuracy (e.g., "Units," "Definitions," "Monographs," etc.).  

### **4. Feature Engineering**  
- Applied **TF-IDF** for keyword weighting.  
- Employed **OpenAI Embeddings** (or **Word2Vec**) for semantic search.  
- Indexed data using **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast vector search.  

### **5. Dataset Splitting**  
- Divided the dataset into:  
  - **80% Training Data** ‚Äì Used for fine-tuning the RAG model.  
  - **20% Test Data** ‚Äì For evaluating model performance.

## üöÄ **Recommended Approach for RAG Chatbot Development**  

### **Step 1: Data Preparation**
- Clean and preprocess the data as outlined above.  
- Generate embeddings using models like **OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002`** or **Sentence-BERT**.  
- Store embeddings in a vector database such as **FAISS**, **ChromaDB**, or **Pinecone**.  

### **Step 2: RAG Model Implementation**
- Use frameworks like **LangChain**, **Haystack**, or **LlamaIndex** for RAG architecture.  
- Implement a retriever to fetch relevant content from the vector store.  
- Design a generator (e.g., **GPT**, **LLaMA**, **Mistral**) to formulate responses based on retrieved data.  

### **Step 3: Evaluation**
- Test the chatbot using relevant sample questions (see below).  
- Evaluate using metrics such as:  
  - **Recall** ‚Äì Measures the model's ability to retrieve relevant information.  
  - **BLEU/ROUGE** ‚Äì To assess response quality.  
  - **User Feedback** ‚Äì For qualitative evaluation.

## üìã **Next Steps**  

1. Train your RAG model using the prepared dataset.  
2. Optimize performance by experimenting with different retriever configurations (e.g., dense retrieval models like **DPR**, **BM25**, etc.).  
3. Evaluate chatbot performance using sample questions and relevant metrics.  
4. Fine-tune the system based on user feedback for improved accuracy.
